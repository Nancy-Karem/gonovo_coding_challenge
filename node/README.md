# Coding Challenge: Merge Two Sorted Arrays API

## Objective

Implement an API endpoint to merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

## Tasks

1. **Implement the Merge Logic**

   - Navigate to `routes/merge.js`.
   - Complete the `mergeSortedArrays` function to efficiently merge `array1` and `array2`.

2. **Input Validation**

   - Ensure that both `array1` and `array2` are arrays of numbers.
   - Ensure that both arrays are sorted in ascending order.

3. **Handle Edge Cases**

   - One or both arrays are empty.
   - Arrays contain duplicate numbers.

4. **Testing**

   - Test your endpoint using tools like Postman or cURL.

## Deliverables

- A working Node.js application with the implemented API endpoint.
- Updated `README.md` with instructions and sample requests.
- Ensure the application runs without errors.

## Bonus

- Add unit tests for the merge function using a testing framework like Jest.
